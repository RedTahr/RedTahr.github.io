### two gents quest to get some knowledge about this infosec thing

So disregarding that I'm in the habit of using github for storing my notes,
or that I'm writing this in a markdown file (when I know very little markdown),
this will be my notes on pottering about trying to learn some things.
There are many more useful resources for those looking to learn, these are 
just my notes so I don't forget things so quickly.

## foreword?

This all came about because our local hacker conference is back again this
year, after taking a year off. And a less techie friend is keen to go,
to paraphrase his comment "sure I may not understand most of it, 
but it'll be an experience".
So I suggested we do some learning together.
Probably starting with overthewire as don't need to setup username/passwords
and such, and its the only one that I could recall.

## getting organised.

So first things first, we probably need ssh and no doubt other linux type
commands will come in handy too. What to do...
Easy option if on Windows 10, turn on the windows subsystem for linux 
and then install Ubuntu from the app store (or open cmd.exe and run bash
and it'll ask to install ubuntu that way too I recall). This will get
us started with basic stuff, later more interesting things won't work
due to current constraints in the subsystem; so networky nmap type
things may not work.
Vaguely less easy, install virtual box and download a pre-setup appliance
from kali or such, which will give you all the things and more.
I've got used to using hyper-v due to my day job, so tend to install stuff
from iso's which is another option.
A more performant option (with less gui) is probably docker, so install
docker and pull kali or such, its a minimum install, but the commands to 
install the top-10 or full or all are easy enough to run.

I should probably be including commands in here...
