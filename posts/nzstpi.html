	<H2>What is a Raspberry Pi and how can it be used in the classroom?</H2>
	<H4>A draft; with references/links; of the article published in Edition 134 of the New Zealand Science Teacher magazine in November 2015. A few weeks before the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/making-pi-zero/" title="The Making of Raspberry Pi Zero">Rasperry Pi Zero</a> came out, hence its omission from the article.</H4>
	<h3>What is a Raspberry Pi, exactly?</h3>
<p>It is a small, smartphone-sized integrated computer (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/" title="The making of Pi">The making of Pi - worth a read, its short</a>) that plugs into a screen or TV via HDMI and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.</p> 
<p>That is if you want to use it as a computer, otherwise you can put it on some wheels, plug in a webcam and with a bit of code turn it into an autonomous vehicle/robot that can identify and <a href="http://www.intorobotics.com/20-hand-picked-raspberry-pi-tutorials-in-computer-vision" title="Pi in computer vision">collect plastic bottles for recycling</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>The seeds of the Pi were planted in 2006, as lecturers of the University of Cambridge pondered a way to combat the yearly decline in the skills and experience of students who were applying to their computer science program. By 2008 technology had become fast enough that their idea looked viable, and in 2012 the first Raspberry Pi was released, providing the world with an easily transportable, cost effective and accessible computer for children and hobbyists alike.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi has excellent and diverse educational resources available for it, not least because the Raspberry Pi Foundation's goal is to advance the computer and computer related education of children and adults, and with the advent of the 'Internet of Things', nearly any object can involve a computer.</p>
<H3>So why would you choose a Raspberry Pi?</H3>
<p>To quote from a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-raspberry-pi-in-scientific-research/" title="Pi in Scientific Research">Pi in scientific research article</a> "The cost implications that come with finding yourself able to buy a computer for US$25 are significant for all of us, but they can make a real difference to the way cash-strapped researchers do things".</p>
<p>The low cost of a Raspberry Pi and the variety of uses it can be put to was a common theme in the feedback from the (mostly secondary school) teachers who responded to my brief survey conducted while researching this article for this publication. Though don't stop reading if you're a primary school teacher, as demonstrated by one YouTube video of a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ssh-shenanigans/">nine year old girl hacking into her Dad's iMac</a> from her Raspberry Pi computer, age is irrelevant and its only imagination and inspiration that will impact how your class embrace the possibilities of a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h3>How are they being used?</h3>
<p>A competition in the UK saw a pair of Westminster School (new entrants to year eight) students design and build an <a href="http://airpi.es/index.php" title="AirPi">Air quality and weather monitoring</a> device based on the Pi which is now a purchasable product.</p>
<p>Secondary schools are using them in extra-curricular roles within <a href="http://www.codeclub.nz/">codeclub</a>, the <a href="http://codeworx.co.nz">codeworx challenge</a> and for <a href="https://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/science-and-technology-fairs">science fairs</a> as well as in class. A few Raspberry Pis have even made it onto the <a href="http://astro-pi.org/">international space station</a>, so why wouldn't you want one?</p>
<p>In the realm of Scientific Research Pi's are finding themselves in all sorts of places and roles, from Chemistry studies with projects looking at fiddler crabs melanin pigment production, and the effect of certain chemical agents on everyones favorite pest, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqbMA1obkFc">Cockroaches</a> through to being used by the <a href="http://gsite.univ-provence.fr/gsite/document.php?pagendx=1031&project=lpc">Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive</a> in <a href="http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/">psychological experiments</a>, which itself is part of a cross-platform <a href="http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/" title="OpenSesame">experiment builder project</a>. If DNA is more your interest then the Centre for Biological Diversity  in Scotland have a program where students can look at the relationship between <a href="http://biodiversity.st-andrews.ac.uk/default.aspx" title="Pi phylogeny reconstruction program">phylogeny and evolution on a Pi</a>.</p>
<h3>What do current students and teachers enjoy about using a Raspberry Pi?</h3>
<p>They enjoy the tangible, visible and real-time feedback of the device. Experimenting and problem solving all aspects of a project via both hardware and software debugging, and then extending what they've created.</p>
<p>Some of the more hazardous science experiments can be safely recorded with a Pi and its camera for reply to the class later, as one <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/science-lessons-with-the-camera-board/" title="Science lessons with a camera board">UK Computer Science and Science teacher</a> has been doing , and even if the experiment goes wrong, you've only lost one Raspberry Pi and camera (and hopefully not too much hair).</p>
<p>"My girls who are learning programming get a more tangible result from their work, plus they get a 'real' use for their new skills. They get a very good understanding of input/output devices and digital signals. Also there are so many online resources this is a good context for finding solutions," said one teacher.</p>
<h3>Teaching computing</h3>
<p>The Pi provides a great platform for teaching about what makes up a computer. With the connection of LEDs to the Pi's GPIO allowing for the creation of a <a href="https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/4804/shift-register-sample" title="8-bit shift register">shift register</a> for example, and only limited by you and your students' creativity in breaking down the functions of a computer into components you can place on a breadboard. And if that's not enough you could always <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/23/brit_mega_processor" title="Hand built 16-bit computer processor">follow this guy</a> and build a life size <a href="http://megaprocessor.com/index.html" title="Mega-processor">16-bit computer processor</a> as a teaching aid.</p>
<p>One aspect of teaching computing is teaching its history, which was wonderfully illustrated at a recent <a href="https://lpoolmakefest.wordpress.com" title="Liverpool MakeFest 2015">Liverpool MakeFest</a> where one project involved children <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/patterncraft/" title="PatternCraft">creating punch cards (with a mallet and steel pin)</a> and reading them in to the Pi to create content in the Minecraft universe. To quote its <a href="http://gemmamaylatham.co.uk">creator Gemma</a>, "Housed in a laser cut plywood box, and built using a Pro Micro Arduino, IR LEDs and Phototransistors, the reader is set up to read rows of holes with an additional registration hole at the end for patterns where a row has no punched hole. The reader is then attached to a Raspberry Pi via the USB port allowing for the input of designs into Minecraft Pi via Python."</p>
<p>The Pi is also heavily used in teaching digital media and digital infrastructure projects, providing an understanding of the layers and protocols the run the internet for example. The constraints imposed by using a Pi, rather than a desktop computer, force a creativity in students that will otherwise be lost for those programming in environments with practically limitless RAM and processor speed. The Pi's ability to be overclocked by changing a simple setting is also a handy teaching aid to demonstrate the impact of CPU and RAM speeds on programs and projects.</p>
<p>As the Raspberry Pi was created as a teaching device there is a wealth of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/" title="Raspberry Pi Teacher Resources">teaching material</a> out there provided by the Raspberry Pi organisation themselves as well as many third party suppliers/resellers hosting forums and guides of their own, and of course an active community generating how-to guides and inspired projects. So as a teaching tool it is very accessible, as even on a bad day when you haven't had time to prepare, you can simply find a good project online and walk through it with the students and still build something by the end of the class.</p>
<h3>Software options</h3>
<p>The Pi runs from a micro-/SD card by default. A noobs SD card is available which provides a selection of Linux operating systems (OS); and can be cheaper than buying the equivalent 8GB SD card too. Being SD card based allows entirely different environments to be experienced with the simple swap of a card, from media centre to desktop word processing to driving a radio controlled tank from your phone. Running from an SD card means its viable to have a classroom worth of Pi's and a schools worth of SD cards with each student allocated their own SD card. So if a student corrupts or deletes the wrong thing on their SD card, then it can just be swapped or rewritten from a backup.</p>
<h3>But what if I'm scared of Linux?</h3>
<p>With the wealth of guidance, howtos and community projects you and the students can learn together; the Raspberry Pi Foundation has a Teacher Resources <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/">teaching section</a> especially for you and there's even Raspberry Pi tutorials, videos and reviews at <a href="http://raspi.tv/">RasPi.TV</a>. That said, a core version of Develop Windows 10 IoT apps on Raspberry Pi 2 and Arduino  <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot" title="Internet of Things">Windows 10</a> came out in 2015, so while you can't boot the Pi into your friendly windows desktop, you can write apps for the Guide to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn894631.aspx">Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</a> which can run on a Raspberry Pi (or windows phone, Xbox, tablet, etc.).</p>
<p>This variety of operating system options is matched by the number of programming languages you can use the Pi to teach, with Python and Scratch being the most popular.</p>
<h3>Shortcomings</h3>
<p>One thing voiced by some of the teachers surveyed was the lack of analogue I/O support on the Raspberry Pi. Any of the projects you see for weather stations (using light, temperature sensors or wind gauges) will include analogue to digital converters. So if you've been excited by an idea double check what other components you'll need to make it happen, as the Pi is often the brain and network connectivity of a project with additional components being provided on breadboards, circuit boards and shields to let it interface with the real world.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So if you are teaching an understanding of computing then a Pi is the leading bit of hardware available today to do that. If you're planning to build a network of wireless environmental monitoring stations, the Pi can do that too, you'll just need to buy some auxiliary components.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with some resources I've become aware of while researching this article, in addition to the numerous ones listed in the footnotes already.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Association of Computing, Digital and Information Technology Teachers "is an association with the goal of advocating for our subjects. The aim of the association is to create a community of teachers where we can share resources, communicate and speak with one voice to get our subject area recognised and supported."</p>
<p>For the budding physicists in the room the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/rpii/">University of Cambridge</a> has a Raspberry Pi project just for you with its aim to "to expose the flexibility and power of using computers in science experiments and will hopefully help students realise that computing is very accessible from a young age."</p>
<p>As for where to buy them, there is <a href="nz.element14.com">Element14</a> which was one of the original supporters and suppliers of the Raspberry Pi, but numerous other avenues have become available as the Raspberry Pi's popularity has increased.</p>
<p>And if you're still needing inspiration, go watch some <a href="http://raspi.tv/">raspi.tv</a>, browse <a href="https://microsoft.hackster.io/">microsoft.hackster.io</a> or be amazed by <a href="www.intorobotics.com/20-hand-picked-raspberry-pi-tutorials-in-computer-vision">tutorials on computer vision</a> using the Raspberry Pi.</p>
