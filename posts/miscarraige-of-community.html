	<H2>a Miscarriage of Community</H2>
	<p>I was saddened by the thought that miscarriage was so common, yet I didn't know anyone who had experienced it. This was while also being devastated by our first miscarriage. Of course it turned out that I knew lots of people, I just didn't know they had miscarried until they knew we had.</p>
	<p>I still have a hard time fathoming where the attitude came from, that during the more nauseously challenging trimester of pregnancy; where you're experience morning sickness; you shouldn't tell anyone. Sure don't broadcast it, but some family, friends, the occasional colleague could know when it comes up in conversation. Then you're not trying to put on a brave face during morning sickness, or the aftermath of miscarriage.</p>
	<p>Yes telling people you've miscarried isn't fun, but then not telling anyone and suffering in silence isn't a positive thing either; I'm pretty sure there's some science out there to validate my opinion on this one.</p>
	<p>I've heard of some cultures that don't count children, they count pregnancies, which I quite like, as each pregnancy is a life, so while some may not make it to the cold hard light of day, at least one of our miscarriages had a heartbeat. I live in fear of my children dying, which is one of those things that no matter how old they and I get, I'm always going to worry about them coming to harm; but that's being a parent I guess.</p>
	<p>Maybe thats part of what makes miscarriage that bit more difficult to process than other grief, as you don't have a visual or tactile (hugs, holding) memory to connect to.</p>
	<p>(Rhetorical) Where has the sense of community gone in much of the world today; obviously I'm in the first world so this is just one of those first world problems. I am constantly disappointed about the lack of solidarity, support and encouragement one finds in your local population, from neighbours to relatives.</p>
