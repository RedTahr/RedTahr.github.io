	<H2>What's my elevator pitch?</H2>
	<p>I want to help undo the damage the modern education system does to people by helping them understand that we're all human and 
		"born creative" and capable of so many things. And that knowing something isn't the same as understanding it.</p>
	<p>By helping people realise that being too self focused is quite self defeating. That seeing the bad in everything only affects your
		health and mood and does nothing to improve your enjoyment of the world.</p>
	<p>By helping restore the sense of community that has been lost in the western world.</p>
