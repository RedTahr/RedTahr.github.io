	<H2>What difference do I want to make?</H2>
	<p>Help restore a sense of community that has been lost in western culture.</p>
	<p>How? I'm not sure yet.</p>
	<p>Western cultural traditions dictate lots of unhelpful things. Such as if you're pregnant, don't talk about it til after 12 weeks
		when the higher risk of misfortune has passed. This means that if you miscarry for example, then no one will know, so you're dealing
		with this intangible loss with at best your partner to console you. Even if the pregnancy goes fine you're still keeping a secret
		during one of the more commonly challenging (morning sickness anyone?) trimesters.</p>
