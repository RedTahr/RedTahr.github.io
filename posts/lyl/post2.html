	<H2>What really makes me angry about the world?</H2>
	<p>How self-centred people are. This is mostly a western/first world rant.</p>
	<p>A persons belief that their experience/hardship/grief is somehow better/bigger/more-important than anothers.</p>
	<p>Males belief that a female is a sub-species to be treated like a possession (trophy wife?) or a source for their next fix (sex).</p>
	<p>Peoples value system being based around material things, and the associated class system that creates.</p>
