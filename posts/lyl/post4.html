	<H2>What's one thing you're proud of?</H2>
	<p>Deciding to ask someone out, who would eventually become my wife.</p>
	<p>For some context, I had never actually asked anyone out, rather merely fell into relationships.</p>
	<p>While this may be an odd thing to be proud of, as it takes two to make a relationship, its one of my fondest memories when I decided
		I would ask her out; if she was still single; upon my return to London, whilst on a solo stroll on the Isle of Barra.</p>
