		<H2>About me</H2>
		<p>Husband, father, geek (in order of priority). I feel that sentence gives a good insight into me.</p>
		<p>More verbosely, I/'m married with children and a programmer living and working in small town NZ. Trying
			to develop new skills and improve on current ones.
		</p>
		<h2>Why blog?</p>
		<p>To learn about myself and workout what drives me, my passion(s).</p>
		<p>I've already written a couple of prior blog posts, but this is my first /'self-improvement/' style one.</p>
