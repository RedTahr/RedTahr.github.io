# my time as non-admin
## running windows 10 as a non administrative user

I've tried, really I have, for more than a year, through having to hand-hold Visual Studio to do updates and the plain headaches of dealing with device manager and hardware drivers.

Yup, for more than a year I've tried to do this Windows 10 life as a non-administrative user, at home and at work.

I remember at University having a lecturer who was adamant you shouldn't run your primary login as an admin user, and with the increase in digital contagions in the wild and the devastating impact of ransomware I thought I'd have a go at life as a non-admin.

Mostly it was fine, but its sucked enough that when I redo this system I won't be continuing this experiment. Ideally by now I'd have evolved to Linux as my primary OS, and have learned the Dvorak; or maybe at least the Colmak; keyboard layout. But time... I'd also know more keyboard shortcuts, but the way in which some of the new Windows 10 UI things are non keyboard friendly mean I've even slacked off on that front too.

Visual Studio updates were always problematic, as the notification system in the IDE would try to start the installer, and not quite succeed. Only meant I had to run the installer as admin myself, not a biggie, but another annoyance.

For the most part I could have created shortcuts for the things that MS have ordained don't have "start as admin" options from the right click menu. But shortcuts are just another thing to setup when you're rebuilding a system or moving to another device.
