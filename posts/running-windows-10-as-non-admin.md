I've tried, really I have, for more than a year, through having to hand hold Visual Studio to do updates and the plain headaches of dealing with device manager and hardware drivers.

Yup, for more than a year I've tried to do this Windows 10 life as a non-administrative user.

I remember at University there was at least one lecturer who was adamant you shouldn't run your primary login as an admin user, and with the increase in digital contagions in the wild and the devastating impact of ransomware I thought I'd have a go at life as a non-admin.

Mostly it was fine, but its sucked enough that when I redo this system next week I won't be continuing this experiment. Ideally by now I'd have evolved to Linux as my primary OS, and have learned the Dvorak; or maybe at least the Colmak; keyboard layout.
