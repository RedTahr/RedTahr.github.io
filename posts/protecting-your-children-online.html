	<H2>Protecting your child online</H2>
	<p>quick update June 2017<br />tl;dr<br />Talk to you kids.<br />setup <a href="https://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>
	or <a href="http://www.safesurfer.co.nz/">Safe Surfer</a> (which has the bonus of a mobile app to do that thing
	when your kids are out of the home wifi)<br>On the topic of education here's one list of resources <a href="http://f0rb1dd3n.com/ir0nin/k1dz.php">F0R H4CK3R K1DZ!</a></p>
<p>In my pursuit to work out how to do what one can to filter the internet for your children I've considered different solutions.
But most of them were "install on device X" type solutions, which somewhat confines the child to using only that device, and how 
likely is that; plus how quickly will the youngster work out how to hack their device and remove said filtering?</p>
<p>Obviously talking to your kid about the Internet/World is your first starting point and ultimate tool in your armory to protect them from others and the web. 
Yet its still nice to be able to do a little bit to filter the deluge of the web from flooding your childs mind, I am reminded of the apt quote of
"there are some things you can't unsee".</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, some of those solutions are good and quite effective. I was impressed with
 <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-NZ/windows-8/family-safety" title="Keep your kids safer on the PC">Microsofts Family Safety</a> solution; 
 under Windows 7; which if I recall correctly even blocked some search engine image results. But it would appear that from Windows 8 (and still
 present in the beta of Windows 10) 
 you need to change the users account to that of child rather than being able to apply the feature to any type of
 user account on the device. I admit I haven't played round to see if a child account is usable by a teenager (i.e. can they install games).</p>
 <p>But I digress, basically the only non-install software solution I've found is to join an Internet provider who provides that service, or set
 your modem/router to use a DNS server that provides that service. The later being the path I took.</p>
 <p>Which is where <a href="https://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> comes into it with their 
 <a href="https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/parental-controls/opendns-familyshield/">Family Shield</a> option. I used their 'configure your own'
 service for a while, but as that requires them to know your IP address to apply your chosen filtering options I eventually switched to their pre-configured
 option.</p><p>Them knowing your IP address isn't an issue if you have a fixed IP address, or you can install their IP updater app that'll update your account with
 your IP address; of course this requires the device the app is installed on to be turned on at some point to ensure your options are applied to your connection.</p>
 <p>You can
 setup an OpenDNS Home account and control what gets filtered and have info about stuff, or you can just set the primary/secondary DNS IP addresses
 on your router to their Family Shield ones and job done (they have two different sets of IP addresses, one for the pre-configured service and one for the
 service you control). You don't need to signup for their pre-configured service, just hit the 
 "<a href="https://store.opendns.com/setup/#/familyshield" title="SET UP FAMILYSHIELD ON YOUR DEVICE">continue without signing up</a>" option.</p>
 <p>At this point you may be thinking it all sounds fine and dandy, but how does one actually set that modem thingy to use whatever the heck a DNS server is?</p>
 <p>Well, your modem came with a manual right? or find it online. The common start point is to log into your modem/router, so from a web browser you'll need to type
 in the routers IP address; this is commonly 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1 and more recently fibre routers tend to be configured with 192.168.20.1 for example.</p>
 <p>Then find two fields near a DNS heading called Primary and Secondary and enter the two DNS entries that OpenDNS has for the service you chose. (Primary
 and Secondary is just incase the first/primary server is busy it'll pass you on to the secondary server)</p>
 <p>I don't have those options you say, or they're not user editable. Well I've noticed that a few Internet providers (like Telecom/Spark, seriously
 who chose that as a rebranding) don't let you set your DNS entries for some reason. So one solution is to Telnet into the modem; which isn't scary;
 you'll probably need to install/enable Telnet on your machine (depending on the system/OS), then search the internet for the commands for your modem
 and the login info, then set the DNS entries that way. Like this aptly titled post on the Blitz Research site, <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.co.nz/Community/posts.php?topic=84954">How to add DNS servers on a router with Telnet</a>.</p>

 <p>You may be thinking I've read this post before, well I did have it on another blog site, but I found their adverts quite trying and generally totally uninteresting/insignificant (mass media drivel), so I deleted my posts and closed my account there.</p>
