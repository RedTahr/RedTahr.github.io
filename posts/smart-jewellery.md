# smart jewellery, gone bust

so I'd bought my wife a 'smart' ring, which she wore. The metal caused an allergic reaction, so it didn't get prolongedu use.

so she goes to use the ring recently...turns out the app had been archived off her iOS into the cloud...and the app was no longer in the store as the company no longer existed...so the app was no longer available to install...

sad smart ring.

...to be continued perhaps...there are lots of folk wanting to be able to use their old smart jewellery, but I also don't have the time to deal with patent trolls complaining that I've reverse engineered some obsolete code.
