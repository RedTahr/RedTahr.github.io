<h2>BYOD at school and a bit of InfoSec</h2>

<p>I'm just a na√Øve programmer trying to help a
non-programmer friend whose youngsters school has gone all BYOD on them.<br>
(or maybe I'll just make them more
paranoid)<br>This has developed over time and now includes more general infosec (information/IT security) opinions for children/people beyond the original BYOD School question.
</p>

<p>First off, the schools BYOD guidance
is lacking, so I'll point them at <a href="http://www.camhigh.school.nz/files/Living%20Documents/FAQ%20parents%20BYOD%20at%20CHS.pdf" target="_blank">Cambridge High Schools one</a> I found as a more
useful example; maybe they can comment on it at the next parent-teacher
night; I'm
not based in Cambridge, that link just happened to show up on the first
page of searches. My main issue with their schools guidance is the
storage capacity requirement which, to quote the doc "Must have enough
storage to download and install software", bit vague there don't you
think? It has no mention of what software or how much space enough
might be. If the school can't give a number here I'm worried about
their abiltiy to provide a safe IT environment for their students.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm stop the ranting and get
back to trying to be helpful. Mainly this is a summary of texting Q/A,
and thoughts I may have missed, and possible notes from a
"keeping your kid safe online" themed post I'd done previously.
</p>

<h3>"Vector of disease"</h3>

<p>(To borrow a phrase my
brother-in-law once used to refer to kids)<br>
</p>

<p>Why I might just be making my friend
paranoid is that I started my text thread with him the other night with
something along the lines of, "...you'll want to prep for the
inevitable fellow pupil bringing malware or ransomware to school.
Higher risk of this if the wifi is school wide and not a classroom
limited affair". Queue the 'how on earth do I protect against that'
style response.</p>

<p>There's the simple things of don't
have the kids account running as admin, 
  enable/force <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS everywhere</a>, have them on their own wifi at
home to limit how easily network mobile infections could spread. If you
can get a decent enough laptop, have it running linux with Wine for
anything that must be Windows based, though I've never tried this and
I'm not sure Office would play nice with Wine, but given that schools
no doubt have Office 365 in the cloud they might get away with never
having the need to actually install Office and get by just using it in
the browser...which again could be an issue as I doubt Edge or Internet
Explorer exist in Linux :-) and I've experienced multiple issues where
certain features of MS online apps don't exist or work if you're not in an MS browser; so maybe thats not such a great idea...</p>

<p>Backup, with a system that won't be
comprimised if their system is. As I implied at the start I'm no guru,
so any opinions are just that. So my backup advice was along the lines
of having an independent system (you know, pick up a raspberry pi or
cheap laptop that'll run linux) and have that being the thing that
takes backups, so infections will hopefully be slowed by the need to
infect a different OS and a different account if the infection wants to
trash your kids backup as well. Yeah this is probably beyond most parents, we'll try to get some non-tech suggestions in here too.</p>

<h4>Hardware specs.</h4>

<p>The high school above is
understandably higher speced than a primary school, but I'd say common
ground is the "windows 10" compatibility thing, beit a chromebook,
laptop or Mac that can run MS Office on, as Office or Google Docs are
probably the two main areas of apps your run of the mill student will
need. So for office, according to that link above, 3GB is needed, and
with windows wanting 10GB on a good day any laptop is likely to have
enough space. As most laptops will have that then its not really a spec
of concern. </p>

<p>As for CPU, most systems a cash strapped parent (have you seen what
it
costs to send a kid to school...) will be looking at will have
Celeron or Atom class chips in them, which is fine as long as the child isn't
in the Audio/Visual (A/V) class at school, which given that the kids
mobile phone can probably record gigs of High Definition (HD) video
will make life a grind if they try editing on their laptop, but for
everything else it'll no doubt suffice; and they can probably edit the video on their phone anyway. </p>

<p>RAM is commonly 4GB, which is sufficient, but again A/V you'll want
more. Lenovo have some very nice "netbook-ish" laptops, a few of which max out with 2GB of RAM, but they still do the job I've heard.</p>

<p>One other thing to think about is connections (USB/HDMI/display-port/VGA/COM/LPT I'm kidding about the last two, kindof), the more the merrier,
so
they have good odds of being able to interface with any tech that their
schools Electronics or A/V class might have knocking about.</p>

<p>My friend was looking at decent celeron based systems with
ample/huge
storage space, I didn't spend much time glancing at the possilbilities
using <a href="https://pricespy.co.nz/category.php?k=353">pricespy</a>,
I think the only system I commented on was a Lenovo with 32GB storage,
and over nine hours battery life, which I thought was decent, as given
the fact the laptop has to last the day and will hopefully get your
child through a few years of school, then you want this number to be
high so as the battery degrades over time then it'll still have the
ability to hold a few hours worth of charge after its been in use for a
few years.
</p>

<h4>Filtering the web</h4>
<p>The only other thing at home that crosses my mind and something I
wrote a previous post on, is the whole net filtering thing at home. I
normally just suggest use <a href="https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/?url=familyshield">FamilyShield
by OpenDNS</a>, a free service that filters most stuff and only
requires your home router to point at their IP address (I wrote how to
do that kinda, but the above link is their setup guide). You can setup
a free account and fully manage the filtering and get logs and stuff
too I recall. Its better than installing some software as then its only
that machine thats filtered.<br>
Actually there was a good twitter thread the other day, a gent teaching
his kids gf to use VPN I think it was, sounds like he ended up
schooling a class worth of kids on VPN use, though as he noted it'd
potentially earn him the ire of parents of said kids if the parents
were trying to "monitor things to keep the children safe". Which is
counterproductive in various ways, mostly the user is the person in the
best position to keep themselves safe, so user education, trust and
responsibility would work better than monitoring the data. Plus how
well is said data going to be reviewed, and who has that time? Makes me
think its a false sense of protection, and introduces an aspect of
distruct into the often already challenging parent/child relationship.</p>
<p>Monitoring the network use might be of interest too, its often handy to see whats using it. 
  You can get this information from the operating system, but one more friendly user experience example is 
  <a href="https://www.glasswire.com/">Glasswire</a>, which among other things shows you whats using the network,
  how much its using it, and provides the option to turn off a given programs network privileges. It does other stuff too, but 
  its bloatware at time of writing</p>
  <p>Privacy on the Web you ask, there are things like <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger by EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)</a>, 
    and various browsers now have "Do Not track" options, which may or may not be respected by websites. And of course as students will
    be in Internet Explorer or Edge a lot of the time then this suggestion isn't that useful :-/ I'd have to look for options for those two.
  </p>
  <p>To take a brief tangent on how to repair Edge for example, MalwareBytes have a blog post on it 
    <a href="https://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-microsoft-edge-popup-ads/">Remove adware, pop-ups and virus from Microsoft Edge (Removal Guide)</a>, 
    which leads into a comment on having PortableApps. As if your child is running as a normal non-admin user and wants to install something,
    then finding a portable version of the given app, or an alternative that has a portable option means they won't need to be admin to run whatever it
    is they're wanting to use. It also means the windows registry and file system won't get fragmented with lots of little things being installed/updated/uninstalled if 
    they try to only use portable/standalone versions of things. <a href="http://portableapps.com/">PortableApps</a> is one handy repository of such apps, and has a nice
    menu system to access/update/download apps too, not that you need to menu to download or run the actual apps</p>
    
  
<h4>Random comments</h4>
  
<p>A possibly handy reference document
is this (albeit two year old, maybe there's a newer version somewhere) <a href="http://www.education.govt.nz/assets/Documents/School/Managing-and-supporting-students/DigitalTechnologySafeAndResponsibleUseInSchs.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Technology: Safe and Responsible use in schools</a>,
I'm including this <a href="http://www.education.govt.nz">education.govt</a>
link purely as another doc to reference
should your schools InfoSec policy fall short, or not exist. It
mentions malware once at least...</p>

  <p>I haven't mentioned antivirus have I. Well its kindof presumed that you'll be running some, ideally the school or national education
  system will have local copies of all the pertinent antivirus definitions so that things all update quickly and easily. But antivirus
  is just a preventative measure rather than bulletproof protection, viruses are hard to detect, just look at the human body, it 
  gets confused about whats dangerous (peanuts anyone) and what isn't, and computers are built by humans, so what chance do they have. 
  Also antivirus can generally mostly only spot the viruses it knows about (from the definitions it updates so regularly), but there are false positives
  and the area of spotting things it doesn't know about, or behaviour (heurestics?) thats dodgy is hard, made moreso by legitimate software 
  doing dodgy stuff itself (Windows 10 anyone). As for which, well if you're running Windows 10 then Windows Defender does as good
    a job as anything, remember Antivirus apps eat up resources (space, battery, memory) and the applications can also provide their
    own attack surface to your system (i.e. they can have hackable vulnerabilities).<br>
  There's MalwareBytes and others for more malware specific scanning/system checks. And when you do think things are awry,
  use one of the online scanners first (see footnote), don't download/install an app (though the online scanners will need to download definitions 
  and stuff before they run), use online tools, or download a bootable disc/usb image and boot from that if need be (or ask your pet technophile).</p>
  
<h5>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h5>
<p>Figured I should include a bit on VPN after I go and mention a random twitter thread and don't actually say what VPN is. 
Before I forget, "why VPN?" you ask, in short means when your kids login to a service or send email a third party who's on the same
network (classroom/school-wide wifi remember) won't be able to see their password or email like reading a postcard in your letterbox.
How easy is that you ask? Well, this is the internet, anything and everything is available, I recall installing an Android app once
just to see how easy it made session hijacking (thats where you see who's on an account of interest and you high jack their login, so you're now them).</p>
<p>There are various ways of doing this, paid or free services, setting up your own. I'd opt for setting up your own on your home router if possible
or on a spare computer (old desktop/laptop, raspberry pi, unloved IoT device whose firmware is totally insecure so no good for the use it was purchased for...)</p>

</ul>
<p>Think I've probably gone too far now with the anxiety inducing aspect of things...oh well, will wait for feedback from my friends.</p>
  
  <h5>External Physical Devices</h5>
  <p>As for protecting your childs device from external devices (<a> href="https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/badusb">BadUSB</a>),
  you could get them a "usb condom", as filling the ports with hotglue isn't a good useability feature. There are a few options, internet search is your friend, there's a kiwi chap who's built one
    such device you can order, <a href="https://github.com/robertfisk/USG">USG is a firewall for your USB ports</a>;
    I have no idea what USG means and its really bugging me.</p>
  <h5>Passwords, and Usernames</h5>
  <p>You can find a lot of info on this, lots of conflicting info. The only advice I'd go with is care of a <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">cartoon on XKCD</a>,
   in short, don't use single words, ideally use a random/nonense phrase thats memorable for your child. The longer the better, but lots of systems
  still have horrible limits (i.e. only eight characters), so have a decent long password, and a decent-ish short one for those programs/sites that are behind the times. 
  Replacing 'a' with '@' doesn't improve security if you're still using a word, like p@ssword, it'll merely make it harder for your child to remember;
  i.e. which characters did I "cunningly" switch for "special characters".</p>
  <p>Should comment on Usernames too I guess. Mainly because we're talking about children. So rule of thumb, ideally don't have any
  identifying info in your username or email address. Like firstname-country-code, JoeNZ for example, lets anyone know you're a kiwi
  named Joe. Not a biggie, but knowing someones name provides an instant degree of familiarity. For emails, if you're in the micrsoft/hotmail/outlook.com 
  ecosystem then have your email that you share, and an alias (or more) on your account (an alias being another email address, whose email
  will appear in the same inbox, unless you filter it sideways or such), then have the email you share not be one that is permitted to login
  to your account/computer (if doing Windows 10 with a non local account). Just provides one less bit of info to anyone wanting to access your childs account(s).</p>
  <p>Two Factor Authentication (2FA), enable it if viable. If your child doesn't have a phone then there are other hardware options, 2FA dongles, do a internet search for them.</p>
  <h5>Social Engineering - Phishing, Spear phishing, Vishing, Spoofing, Whaling</h5>
  <p>One thing to remind your child of, is that of messages from friends or teachers that seem odd. Odd in the sense the email address isn't quite right, or the 
  style of the email is not in keeping with the supposed author, or there are more typos than usual. As the email could be a bit of social engineering attack, or they may
   have just infected themselves with malware/virus if they've opened the message in a normal email client already and the email had such a payload.</p>
<br>

<hr>
<p>Online Virus Scanners, there are others, some of which provide no "fix" option unless you pay for their product</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/forHome/products/housecall.html">HouseCall - Free Online Virus Scan</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.eset.com/us/home/online-scanner/">Free Virus Scan | Online Virus Scan from ESET</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/scanner/online/free.html">Bitdefender Quick Scan Free Online Virus Scan</a> is the fast/lightweight option</li>
  </ul> 
  
<p>All typos and grammatical errors are because this is written in something with notepad grade spell checking ability :-)<br>
