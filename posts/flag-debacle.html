	<H2 style="font-family:Arial">So how would you carry out a Flag Referendum</H2>
    <p style="font-family:Arial">For starters, one needs an alternative. So who to design that, crowd source it?</p>
    <p style="font-family:Arial">How ever one arrives at an alternative flag design or two, it only makes sense (common sense?) that a team
         comprised of people who design flags and maybe folk who use flags (Captains of the seafaring variety, i.e. a Ships Captain) should be involved, and the last line
        defense against impractical or unsuitable designs.</p>
       <p style="font-family:Arial">Obviously the first line(s) of defence would include filtering out designs of a topical nature or containing brands (sports logos anyone?). As
           they can and do change far more frequently than a nations flag does.</p>
       <p style="font-family:Arial">It's a pity that certain political folk didn't recieve such simple guidance from their counsel before wasting tax payers money on a referendum that
           narrowly failed in achieving anything. Which I'm glad about as I would have been quite dismayed to become a nation with the current sporting brand
           being part of the flag. What were they thinking, were they going to call a flag referendum everytime the sports teams redesign their wardrobe?</p>
           <p style="font-family:Arial">In case you're missing some context, I'm just voicing my disappointment at the current political leadership of New Zealand.</p>
