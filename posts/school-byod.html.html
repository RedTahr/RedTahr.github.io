<h2>BYOD at school and IT safety</h2>

<p>I'm just a naïve programmer trying to help a
non-programmer friend who's youngsters school has gone all BYOD on them.<br>
(or maybe I'll just make them more
paranoid)<br>
</p>

<p>First off, the schools BYOD guidance
is lacking, so I'll point them at <a href="http://www.camhigh.school.nz/files/Living%20Documents/FAQ%20parents%20BYOD%20at%20CHS.pdf" target="_blank">Cambridge High Schools one</a> I found as a more
useful example; maybe they can comment on it at the next parent-teacher
night; I'm
not based in Cambridge, that link just happened to show up on the first
page of searches. My main issue with their schools guidance is the
storage capacity requirement which, to quote the doc "Must have enough
storage to download and install software", bit vague there don't you
think? It has no mention of what software or how much space enough
might be. If the school can't give a number here I'm worried about
their abiltiy to provide a safe IT environment for their students.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm stop the ranting and get
back to trying to be helpful. Mainly this is a summary of texting Q/A,
and thoughts I may have missed, and possible notes from previous
"keeping your kid safe online" themed post I'd done previously.
</p>

<h3>"Vector of disease"</h3>

<p>(To borrow a phrase I heard my
brother-in-law use to refer to kids once)<br>
</p>

<p>Why I might just be making my friend
paranoid is that I started my text thread with him the other night with
something along the lines of, "...you'll want to prep for the
inevitable fellow pupil bringing malware or ransomware to school.
Higher risk of this if the wifi is school wide and not a classroom
limited affair". Queue the 'how on earth do I protect against that'
style
response.</p>

<p>There's the simple things of don't
have the kids account running as admin, have them on their own wifi at
home to limit how easily network mobile infections could spread. If you
can get a decent enough laptop, have it running linux with Wine for
anything that must be Windows based, though I've never tried this and
I'm not sure Office would play nice with Wine, but given that schools
no doubt have Office 365 in the cloud they might get away with never
having the need to actually install Office and get by just using it in
the browser...which again could be an issue as I doubt Edge or Internet
Explorer exist in Linux :-) as I've experienced multiple issues where
certain features don't exist or work if you're not in an MS browser.</p>

<p>Backup, with a system that won't be
comprimised if their system is. As I implied at the start I'm no guru,
so any opinions are just that. So my backup advice was along the lines
of having an independent system (you know, pick up a raspberry pi or
cheap laptop that'll run linux) and have that being the thing that
takes backups, so infections will hopefully be slowed by the need to
infect a different OS and a different account if the infection wants to
trash your kids backup as well.</p>

<h4>Hardware specs.</h4>

<p>The high school above is
understandably higher speced than a primary school, but I'd say common
ground is the "windows 10" compatibility thing, beit a chromebook,
laptop or Mac that can run MS Office on, as Office or Google Docs are
probably the two main areas of apps your run of the mill student will
need. So for office, according to that link above, 3GB is needed, and
with windows wanting 10GB on a good day any laptop is likely to have
enough space. As most laptops will have that then its not really a spec
of concern. </p>

<p>As for CPU, most systems a cash strapped parent (have you seen what
it
costs to send a kid to school...) will be looking at things with
Celeron class chips in them, which is fine as long as the child isn't
in the Audio/Visual (A/V) class at schooll, which given that the kids
mobile phone can probably record gigs of High Definition (HD) video
will make life a grind if they try editing that on a Celeron, but for
everything else it'll no doubt suffice. </p>

<p>RAM is commonly 4GB, which is sufficient, but again A/V you'll want
more.</p>

<p>One other thing to think about is connections, the more the merrier,
so
they have good odds of being able to interface with any tech that their
schools Electronics or A/V class might have knocking about.</p>

<p>My friend was looking at decent celeron based systems with
ample/huge
storage space, I didn't spend much time glancing at the possilbilities
using <a href="https://pricespy.co.nz/category.php?k=353">pricespy</a>,
I think the only system I commented on was a Lenovo with 32GB storage,
and over nine hours battery life, which I thought was decent, as given
the fact the laptop has to last the day and will hopefully get your
child through a few years of school, then you want this number to be
high so as the battery degrades over time then it'll still have the
ability to hold a few hours worth of charge after its been in use for a
few years.<br>
</p>

<h4>Random comments<br>
</h4>

<p>The only other thing at home that crosses my mind and something I
wrote a previous post on, is the whole net filtering thing at home. I
normally just suggest use <a href="https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/?url=familyshield">FamilyShield
by OpenDNS</a>, a free service that filters most stuff and only
requires your home router to point at their IP address (I wrote how to
do that kinda, but the above link is their setup guide). You can setup
a free account and fully manage the filtering and get logs and stuff
too I recall. Its better than installing some software as then its only
that machine thats filtered.<br>
Actually there was a good twitter thread the other day, a gent teaching
his kids gf to use VPN I think it was, sounds like he ended up
schooling a class worth of kids on VPN use, though as he noted it'd
potentially earn him the ire of parents of said kids if the parents
were trying to "monitor things to keep the children safe". Which is
counterproductive in various ways, mostly the user is the person in the
best position to keep themselves safe, so user education, trust and
responsibility would work better than monitoring the data. Plus how
well is said data going to be reviewed, and who has that time? Makes me
think its a false sense of protection, and introduces an aspect of
distruct into the often already challenging parent/child relationship.<br>
</p>

<p>A possibly handy reference document
is this (albeit two year old, maybe there's a newer version somewhere) <a href="http://www.education.govt.nz/assets/Documents/School/Managing-and-supporting-students/DigitalTechnologySafeAndResponsibleUseInSchs.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Technology: Safe and Responsible use in schools</a>,
I'm including this <a href="http://www.education.govt.nz">education.govt</a>
link purely as another doc to reference
should your schools InfoSec policy fall short, or not exist. It
mentions malware once at least...</p>
